# Server-side Google Analytics 4

This lib allows you to communicate with GA4 from a server environment.
Exceptionally useful to server-only apps like telegram bots.

⚠️ Project status: code should work, but am not sure. At the moment I don't have a specific use for this project, yet it's potentialy a very powerful lib, so I'll leave it here, and come back when i'll need it again. Feel free to reach out for any questions, because as far a i know, it is the only way to une google analytics with a telegram bot.
